					</ul>	
					<p>For example, you provide information when you search for a product; place an order through our store; provide information to our Member Services department; provide information in your personal profile (or profiles, if you have more than one); communicate with us by phone, email, or otherwise; complete a questionnaire; or use other Toastmasters.org features. As a result of those actions, you might supply us with such information as your name (or another person's), address, and phone numbers; credit card information; people to whom purchases have been shipped, including addresses and phone number; content of emails to us; personal information (your name and any Toastmasters International honors or awards you’ve received); and financial information.</p>

					<p>You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features. We use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, customizing your future visits to the Toastmasters website and shopping, improving our website, and communicating with you.</p>
					<h4><strong><em>Information we collect and how we collect it:</em></strong> </h4>
					<p><strong>We collect several types of information from and about users of our website, including information:</strong></p>
					<ul>
						<li>By which you may be personally identified, including your name, postal address, email address or telephone number ("personal information");</li>
						<li>That is about you but individually does not identify you, such as age, gender, language preferences, expertise, date of birth; and/or about your internet connection, the equipment you use to access our website and usage details.</li>
					</ul>

					<p><strong>We collect this information:</strong></p>
					<ul>
						<li>Directly from you when you provide it to us.</li>
						<li>Automatically as you navigate through the website. Information collected automatically may include usage details, Information Protocol (IP) addresses and information collected through cookies, and other tracking technologies.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many websites, we use "cookies," and we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses Toastmasters.org.&nbsp;<br>
					<br>
					Examples of the information we collect and analyze include the Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet; login to Toastmasters.org; email address; your Toastmasters.org password; computer and connection information such as browser type and version, operating system, and platform; shopping history, which we sometimes combine with similar information from other customers to create special website features; the full Uniform Resource Locator (URL) clickstream to, through, and from our website, including date and time (how you arrived, navigated through and exited Toastmasters.org); cookie number; products you viewed. During some visits we may use software tools such as JavaScript, to measure and collect session information, including page response times, download errors, length of visits to certain pages, page interaction information (such as scrolling, clicks, and mouse-overs), and methods used to browse away from the page. This information is collected in the interest of making the Toastmasters website work better for you.</p>
					<p>The information we collect automatically is statistical data, and does not identify any individual. It helps us to improve our website and to deliver a better and more personalized service by enabling us to:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Estimate our audience size, browser statistics, and popularity of content and usage patterns.</li>
						<li>Speed up your searches.</li>
						<li>Recognize you when you return to our website.</li>
					</ul>
					<p> A number of companies offer utilities designed to help you visit websites anonymously. Although we will not be able to provide you with a personalized experience at Toastmasters.org if we cannot recognize you, we want you to be aware that these tools exist. In addition, the Federal Trade Commission provides useful information about online privacy on its own website,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.privacy.ca.gov/" target="_blank">http://www.privacy.ca.gov/</a>. &nbsp;</p>
					<p><strong><em>Information from Other Sources:&nbsp;</em></strong>Third party advertisers&nbsp;may appear on our website from time to time. They may be able to detect that visitors to their website arrived via Toastmasters.org. However, we do not receive any information from these or other outside websites regarding your page views, purchases or any other information.</p>

					<h3>What about cookies?</h3>
					<p>Cookies are tiny bits of information that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and to provide features such as your personalized profile.</p>
					<p>The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. However, cookies allow you to take full advantage of some of Toastmasters.org's most entertaining and helpful features, and we recommend that you leave them turned on.</p>
